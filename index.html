            <ul>
                <li>
                    Restrict visitors to the house. If they must be there, have them follow all the same precautions the house is doing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have a designated bathroom for anyone who is sick.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If cooking communal meals, wash hands for at least 20 seconds with hot water. Wear gloves if possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the dishwasher if you have one, instead of handwashing. Many have a sanitation setting that can used to sanitize all dishes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every morning and night, designate someone to sanitize all door knobs and handles in the house.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wash hands immediately after entering the house.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep a healthy stock of cold and flu medicine, Tylenol, pedialite, and anything else that will help if someone is sick.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take care of each other! Bring dinners to the sick person's room, maybe make some tea for them if they're not leaving their room. Looking out for each other is crucial.

            <ul class="faq">
                <li id="social-distancing">
                    What is social distancing?
                </li>
                <p>
                    Social distancing is when you mostly stay at home, and only leave to get essentials like groceries or gas for your car. It is a way to help prevent spreading the virus.
                </p>
                <li>
                    I'm not sick, why should I practice social distancing?
                </li>
                <p>
                    Just because you aren't sick doesn't mean you aren't a carrier of the virus. Staying at home and only leaving the house for essentials protects other people, who are more at risk.
                </p>
                <li>
                    My housemate is sick but we don't know if it's the coronavirus. What do we do?
                </li>
                <p>
                    If your housemate is sick, it's good to act like it's the coronavirus even if it's just a cold. Discuss what works best with your house, and use the above <a href="#quarantine-guide">quarantine methods</a> as a guide.
                </p>
                <li>
                    Everything has been stressful and overwhelming, and I don't know what to do.
                </li>
                <p>
                    Let a trusted housemate or board member know! It's understandable that this could be impacting your house responsibilities. The world is messed up right now, and we are all dealing with a collective sadness that is unprecedented. Focus on taking care of yourself.
